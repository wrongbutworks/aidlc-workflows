# Cross-Unit Integration Testing

MANDATORY: Follow stage-protocol.md for approval gates, question format, and completion messages.

Unlike `build-and-test`, which runs per the unit boundary, this stage runs ONCE
after all units are built — so it can test that the units COMPOSE. It exercises
the cross-unit seams the per-unit tests structurally cannot see.

## Steps

### Step 1: Load Agent Personas

Load aidlc-quality-agent persona from `agents/aidlc-quality-agent.md` and knowledge from `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/aidlc-quality-agent/`.
Load test-pro-metrics-agent support persona from `agents/test-pro-metrics-agent.md` and knowledge from `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/test-pro-metrics-agent/`.

### Step 2: Read All Per-Unit Outputs

Read every unit's code summary and build-and-test output from the per-unit
construction record dirs and the cross-unit `build-and-test-summary`. Build
the cross-unit view: which units call which, the shared contracts, the data that
crosses unit boundaries.

### Step 3: Identify Cross-Unit Seams

Enumerate the integration points — API calls between units, shared data
contracts, event/message boundaries, shared state. Produce
`test-pro-cross-unit-contract-matrix.md` mapping each seam to the contract it
must honor.

### Step 4: Generate the Integration Test Plan

Write `test-pro-integration-test-plan.md`: for each seam, the integration tests
(happy path + contract violation + failure propagation across the boundary).

### Step 5: Execute Integration Tests

Run the integration tests against the assembled units. Capture results into
`test-pro-integration-test-results.md` (total / passed / failed, with the seam
each failure touches).

### Step 6: Update State

Update `<record>/aidlc-state.md`: mark test-pro-integration as `[x]` completed and update "Current Status".

### Step 7: Present Completion & Request Approval

Completion emoji: :link:

Standard 2-option approval (Approve / Request Changes).

## Sensors

This stage's outputs are markdown artefacts under its record dir. The imported `required-sections` and `upstream-coverage` sensors check those outputs.

## Learn

While running this stage, maintain a running log in
`<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md` (create on stage start if absent).
Append entries under: Interpretations, Deviations, Tradeoffs, Open questions —
each with an ISO 8601 timestamp.

Stage files are immutable framework artefacts — the ritual writes into the
harness, not into this file.
