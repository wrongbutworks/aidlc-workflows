## Prerequisites

{{SLOT:prereq_bullets}}
- **Locking**: Audit log file locking is handled portably using mkdir-based locking in the system temp directory (no external dependencies).
- **Hook permissions**: All 11 hooks are TypeScript (`.ts`) and run via `bun`. No executable bits required — works identically on macOS, Linux, and native Windows PowerShell.

## AI-DLC Structure

- **Skill**: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/skills/aidlc/` — Orchestrator (`SKILL.md`), stage protocol, and 32 stage files across 5 phase directories
- **Session skills** (read-only, user-invocable): `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/skills/aidlc-session-cost/`, `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/skills/aidlc-replay/`, `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/skills/aidlc-outcomes-pack/` — typed as `{{INVOKE}}-session-cost`, `{{INVOKE}}-replay`, `{{INVOKE}}-outcomes-pack`. Each pulls every count from `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-runtime.ts summary --json` (no LLM-side counting). Classified `read-only`: they never advance the workflow stage pointer and never emit audit events. `aidlc-session-cost` and `aidlc-replay` print to the terminal only; `aidlc-outcomes-pack` is the only one that writes a file (`OUTCOMES.md`).
- **Stage-runner skills** (user-invocable): `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/skills/aidlc-<stage>/` — one per runnable core stage, typed as `{{INVOKE}}-<stage>` (e.g. `{{INVOKE}}-application-design`, `{{INVOKE}}-code-generation`); plugin-owned stages use their bare plugin-prefixed command name. Each runs that single stage in isolation via the engine's `--single` mode (`aidlc-orchestrate next --stage <slug> --single`) and **never advances your main workflow's `Current Stage`** — a single-stage run is isolated by design (the tool refuses to advance the main workflow). They are opt-in packaging: the same stage is reachable via `{{INVOKE}} --stage <slug> --single` without a runner. The runner set is generated from the compiled stage graph by `bun {{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/aidlc-runner-gen.ts write` and kept in sync by its `check` drift guard, so adding a stage file and regenerating adds its runner. The three bootstrap **initialization** stages ship no per-stage runner (they have no standalone meaning); the whole initialization phase is packaged as `{{INVOKE}}-init`, which mints the first intent and builds its state in one step. (This is opt-in packaging: the engine normally auto-births the first intent the moment you describe what to build — no separate initialization command is needed.)
- **Agents**: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/agents/` — 11 domain-expert personas (product, design, delivery, architect, aws-platform, compliance, devsecops, developer, quality, pipeline-deploy, operations). {{SLOT:agents_note}}
- **Method/rules**: `aidlc/spaces/<space>/memory/` — Layered files authored once at the workspace root, read by each harness via its native include (no copy into `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/`): `org.md` (framework defaults + organisation-wide guardrails), `team.md` (this team's affirmed practices), `project.md` (project-specific specialisation), plus `phases/<phase>.md` for ideation, inception, construction, and operation (initialization is bootstrap-only and ships no rule file). Resolution is a strict-additive five-layer chain — `org → team → project → phase → stage` — where every applicable rule appears in `rules_in_context` at runtime. Conflicts (narrower contradicting broader policy) are rejected at the §13 learning admission check before the learning reaches disk. See `docs/reference/01-architecture.md` § "Configuration layers" and `docs/reference/08-rule-system.md` for the schema.
- **Sensors**: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/sensors/` — Deterministic verification manifests (advisory). Ships with framework defaults (`aidlc-required-sections.md`, `aidlc-upstream-coverage.md`, `aidlc-linter.md`, `aidlc-type-check.md`); forks may add custom `aidlc-<id>.md` manifests. Stages declare which sensors fire via the frontmatter `sensors: [<id>]` list — a pull import resolved at compile time. The PostToolUse hook reads the compile-resolved `sensors_applicable` array off the stage graph node.
- **Knowledge**: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/knowledge/` — Methodology reference. Per-agent under `aidlc-<agent>-agent/` subfolders; `aidlc-shared/` holds cross-agent material. Ships with framework.
- **Team Knowledge**: `aidlc/knowledge/` (i.e. `aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/`) — User-managed team and domain knowledge, a space-level sibling of `memory/`/`codekb/`/`intents/` that accumulates across every intent in the space. Free-form and empty at bootstrap (no fixed file set, no seeded READMEs); the engine ensure-exists the empty dir on your first `{{INVOKE}}`. Agents read `aidlc/knowledge/aidlc-shared/` (all agents) and `aidlc/knowledge/<agent>/` (that agent) if the team creates them.
- **Tools**: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/tools/` — Deterministic CLI tools (TypeScript, run via bun). All framework files prefixed `aidlc-*.ts`. They cover state management, audit emission, the orchestration engine (`aidlc-orchestrate.ts` with its `next`/`report` subcommands), graph compile, runner generation, sensor firing, the §13 learnings gate (`aidlc-learnings.ts`), and the swarm convergence referee (`aidlc-swarm.ts`).
- **Hooks**: `{{HARNESS_DIR}}/hooks/` — Framework hooks for audit emission, session lifecycle, state sync, state validation, subagent tracking, and statusline rendering. All framework files prefixed `aidlc-*.ts`.

## Conventions

- All artifacts go under the active intent's record dir — `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<slug>-<id8>/` (shorthand `<record>/`) — beneath the neutral `aidlc/` workspace roof; application code goes to the workspace root (or a sibling repo). Single-team users only ever see `spaces/default/`.
- Each stage keeps an observation diary at `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`, auto-created from a template at stage start and maintained by the orchestrator — never hand-edited
- Use emojis as defined in skill/stage files — reproduce them exactly
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax before writing; include text fallback
- Validate all generated content for character escaping issues

{{SLOT:sections_before_resumption}}
## Session Resumption

On startup, resolve the active intent (the `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/active-intent` cursor) and check for its `<record>/aidlc-state.md`. If found, load prior context and offer to resume from last checkpoint. (A brand-new workspace has no intent yet — the engine auto-births the first one on your first `{{INVOKE}}`.)
{{SLOT:sections_after_resumption}}
## Git Integration

Commit the `aidlc/` workspace tree — the record (state, the per-clone audit shards under `<record>/audit/`, `intents.json`), memory, codekb, and knowledge are all version-controlled. The shipped `.gitignore` excludes the per-user cursors and machine-local runtime (these may be per-clone or contain sensitive data):
- `aidlc/active-space` and `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/active-intent` (per-user cursors)
- `aidlc/.aidlc-clone-id` (per-clone audit-shard token) and `aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/`
- `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/*/runtime-graph.json` (also covers per-Bolt worktree fragments by relative-path glob)
- `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/*/.aidlc-*` (recovery, hooks-health, sensors scratch)
