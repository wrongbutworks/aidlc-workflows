# Adding an Agent

An agent is the *who* of the framework — a persona with a domain, a tool
allowlist, and a tier. The 11 shipped agents cover product, design, delivery,
architecture, AWS platform, compliance, DevSecOps, development, quality,
pipeline-deploy, and operations. When your team needs a domain the framework
doesn't cover (a data-governance reviewer or a mobile specialist, say), you
add a persona by dropping a single Markdown file
into `core/agents/`. No TypeScript.

This chapter walks the workflow: what a persona file is, the judgment calls in
its frontmatter, and the two-step truth that an agent which is *visible* is not
yet *active*. For the field-by-field contract, it links down to the Developer
Reference. For who these agents are from a user's seat, see the [User Guide —
Agents](../guide/06-agents.md).

## What a persona file is, and where it lives

Every agent is one flat file at `core/agents/<slug>-agent.md`: YAML
frontmatter on top, a Markdown body below. The shipped files all carry the
`aidlc-` prefix (`aidlc-architect-agent.md`, `aidlc-developer-agent.md`); a file
you add is yours and need not use that prefix. Treat the shipped 11 as
framework files — they get overwritten on upgrade, so customize *what an
existing agent knows* through team knowledge rather than editing the file (see
[Team knowledge](07-team-knowledge.md)). A genuinely new persona is a different
move: a new file, owned by you, that survives upgrades.

The frontmatter is the part the framework parses. The body is prose the agent
reads about itself when it activates — its responsibilities, the stages it
owns, how it loads knowledge, its working principles. Only the frontmatter is
machine-read; the body is for the agent's own framing, and you write it to
match the structure of the shipped files.

Here is the frontmatter from a real agent, authored at
`core/agents/aidlc-architect-agent.md`:

```yaml
---
name: aidlc-architect-agent
display_name: Architect Agent
examples:
  - tech-stack.md
  - infrastructure-preferences.md
description: >
  Solutions architect responsible for application design, domain modelling,
  NFR patterns, and component decomposition.
disallowedTools: Task
tier: judgment
---
```

## The frontmatter contract, and the calls you make

The full field-by-field schema lives in the reference; here are the judgment
calls you actually make when authoring one.

**`name` must match the filename stem.** A file at
`aidlc-data-governance-agent.md` declares `name: aidlc-data-governance-agent`.
The parser keys off this, and a mismatch is the easiest way to author an agent
that never resolves. The loader rejects duplicate agent `name` values across
files and names both files in the error.

**An agent inherits the full session toolset by default.** None of the 11
shipped agents declare a `tools:` allowlist, so each one reaches every tool the
session provides — `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `AskUserQuestion`,
`Bash`, `WebSearch`, and the inherited MCP tools alike. To narrow a persona,
add an optional `tools:` allowlist naming only the tools it may use. Listing
`tools:` narrows the persona to exactly the tools it names, and it drops the inherited
MCP tools unless you also name the fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids
(see the MCP-inheritance note below). Reach for it only when a domain genuinely
needs a smaller surface; most personas are best left to inherit everything.

**MCP servers are inherited, not granted per agent.** The five MCP servers declared in the project-root `.mcp.json` are provisioned to the session, and every agent inherits all of them automatically — there is no per-agent grant to author. To keep a persona *away* from a server, narrow its `tools:` allowlist to a fully-qualified `mcp__<server>__<tool>` list that omits that server (a bare `mcp__<server>` token is a no-op, not a server-level grant). The inheritance and restriction model is exercised by the `t110` registry-integrity test (see [Testing](../reference/09-testing.md)).

**`disallowedTools` must include `Task`.** This is not optional. Agents run as
delegated workers; the conductor (the live `/aidlc` session) performs the `Task`
call when the engine's `run-stage` directive carries `mode: subagent`. Allowing
`Task` would let an agent spawn its own subagents, cascading delegation chains
the framework is built to prevent. Every shipped agent disallows `Task`, and so
must yours.

**`tier` names the kind of work; the packager projects it into per-harness
model/effort keys.** You never author raw `model:` or `effort:` in core agent
frontmatter -- those are projection OUTPUTS in `dist/<harness>/`, derived from
the tier table in `core/tools/aidlc-tiers.ts`. Pick `judgment` for any persona
whose work is multi-constraint reasoning that cascades downstream --
interpreting ambiguous intent, weighing architectural trade-offs under dense
context; a judgment agent inherits the session's model AND effort, so it is
never silently downgraded. Pick `balanced` for reviewer-shaped personas that
judge novel input against explicit criteria. Pick `templated` only when the
output is dominantly pattern-following and the methodology is already encoded
in the agent's knowledge files, as with delivery plans, CI/CD YAML, and
runbook scaffolding -- templated is the one tier that steps effort down. When
in doubt, use `judgment`: the projection table (and a project's `tier_cap`)
can always step cost down later, but a persona authored too low silently
under-reasons. See [Agent System](../reference/05-agent-system.md) for the
full projection table and the cap override.

Two more fields drive presentation rather than behavior. `display_name` is the
human-readable label the statusline renders (the architect shows as "Architect
Agent"). `examples` lists suggested knowledge filenames documented in the
agent→examples table — they are *suggestions surfaced to the user*; the runtime
never loads them and the engine never writes them to disk.

For the exact required/optional table and the shared-configuration matrices,
see [Agent System: Frontmatter Contract](../reference/05-agent-system.md#frontmatter-contract).

## Visible is not active: the two-step truth

This is the one thing to internalize. Dropping the file makes the agent
*visible*; wiring it into a stage makes it *active*. Both steps are required, or
you get an agent that exists and never runs.

- **Discovery makes it visible.** `loadAgents()` in
  `.claude/tools/aidlc-lib.ts` reads every `.md` file in
  `.claude/agents/` on the next invocation and derives the metadata map. No code
  edit, no registration step — the file's presence is the registration. From
  this point the statusline can render its display name, and the team can add
  standards under its space-level `aidlc/knowledge/<slug>-agent/` directory.
- **Stage binding makes it active.** A stage names its lead and support agents
  by slug in its frontmatter `lead_agent` / `support_agents` fields (compiled
  into `.claude/tools/data/stage-graph.json`). Until some stage references your
  slug, no `run-stage` directive names it, so the conductor never delegates to the persona.

This mirrors the framework's core asymmetry — a stage names its agent; an agent
never names its stages. So the agent file alone is inert by design. To put your
new persona to work, edit the stage that should use it; the binding mechanics
live in [Adding a Stage](02-adding-a-stage.md).

Each agent also pairs with a knowledge directory you author at
`core/knowledge/aidlc-<slug>-agent/` (framework methodology) and an optional team
overlay at the space level, `aidlc/knowledge/<slug>-agent/` (your standards). The
space-level `aidlc/knowledge/` directory is free-form and empty at bootstrap; the
team creates the per-agent subdirectory when it has content — the engine does not
scaffold it. The two-tier knowledge workflow is covered in
[Team knowledge](07-team-knowledge.md).

## The steps

Mirroring the reference recipe, here is the workflow end to end.

1. **Create the agent file** — `core/agents/<slug>-agent.md` with the
   required frontmatter: `name`, `display_name`, `examples`, `description`,
   `disallowedTools` (including `Task`), `tier`. An optional `tools:`
   allowlist narrows the persona; omit it to inherit the full session toolset.
   Write the body to match the shipped files' structure (Core Responsibilities,
   Stages Owned, Collaboration, Knowledge Loading, Key Principles).
2. **Add knowledge files** under `core/knowledge/aidlc-<slug>-agent/` for the
   methodology the persona should load on activation.
3. **Wire it into stages** — add the slug to the `lead_agent` /
   `support_agents` frontmatter of each stage file (`core/aidlc-common/stages/<phase>/<slug>.md`)
   where it leads or supports, then recompile (`bun .claude/tools/aidlc-graph.ts compile`)
   so `stage-graph.json` regenerates. Never hand-edit `stage-graph.json` — it is
   a build artifact, and the next compile overwrites a manual change (see
   [Adding a Stage](02-adding-a-stage.md#4-compile-so-stage-graphjson-regenerates)).
   This is the step that makes it active.
4. **Document the team-knowledge directory** — note that a team adds its
   standards under the space-level `aidlc/knowledge/<slug>-agent/`. The engine
   does not create this directory; the team creates it when it has content (the
   space's `aidlc/knowledge/` is free-form and empty at bootstrap).
5. **Update the hand-maintained doc tables** — the Phase Participation matrix
   and the agent→examples table do not regenerate themselves (see what does NOT
   validate, below).

The full recipe — with the discovery, intent-birth, and statusline verification
commands — is in [Contributing: Adding an Agent](../reference/11-contributing.md#adding-an-agent).
To change an existing agent's tools, tier, or stage assignments rather than add
one, see [Agent System: How to Modify an Agent](../reference/05-agent-system.md#how-to-modify-an-agent).

### What validates automatically

- `loadAgents()` discovers any new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` on next
  invocation — no code edit, no registration.
- The parser throws if `name` or `display_name` is missing, naming the file and
  the missing field.
- Agents are returned alphabetically sorted by slug, so discovery order is
  identical on every platform.
- Intent birth creates the empty space-level `aidlc/knowledge/` directory; it
  does not seed per-agent subdirectories or READMEs.
- The statusline renders the display name from the derived metadata.

### What does NOT validate automatically

- **Stage-graph participation.** `stage-graph.json` references agents by slug;
  add an agent without wiring it there and it exists but never runs. Discovery
  and activation are separate steps.
- **Knowledge-file existence.** `examples` are suggested filenames documented in
  the agent→examples table — nothing creates or checks them. You place the real
  content under `aidlc/knowledge/<slug>-agent/` (the space-level knowledge dir).
- **The hand-maintained doc tables.** The Phase Participation matrix in
  [Agent System](../reference/05-agent-system.md#phase-participation) and the
  agent→examples table in the knowledge README template are edited by hand.
  Update them in the same change that adds the agent.
- **The agent file's body.** Only the frontmatter is parsed; the body prose is
  read by the agent itself when it activates, so write it carefully to match the
  shipped 11.
