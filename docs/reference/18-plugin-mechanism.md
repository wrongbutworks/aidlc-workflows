# The Plugin Mechanism

> Audience: Tier 2/3 (team adopter, framework contributor).

> **Path convention.** `<harness-dir>/` below = the harness's runtime dir (`.claude` / `.codex` / `.kiro`); `plugins/<name>/` = the authored plugin source; `dist/plugins/<name>/<harness>/` = the emitted, installable host plugin.

This chapter is the canonical reference for the **AIDLC plugin** system: an optional, owned, versioned set of contributions — new stages, agents, scopes, method/rules, sensors, and *additive modifications to existing core stages* — authored once as a harness-neutral tree and **emitted as a real host plugin** for each harness. A plugin never edits `core/`; with every plugin disabled an install is byte-identical to bare core. The system generalizes the one proven edit-free seam (phase rules composed additively) to every surface, and delivers it through each host's own plugin machinery rather than a bespoke installer. Cross-link to [Stage Definition](15-stage-definition.md) (the stage frontmatter a plugin authors, including `plugin`/`number`/`when`), [Engine and Skill System](17-skill-system.md) (the graph the composer feeds and the orchestrator routes off), [Artifact Vocabulary](16-artifact-vocabulary.md) (the namespacing rule), and the authoring walkthrough [Authoring a Plugin](../harness-engineering/10-authoring-a-plugin.md).

## 1. What a plugin is

A plugin is a directory (and a git repository) with a declarative manifest and core-shaped subtrees. It can:

- **add** new stages (in their own display-number range), agents, scopes, method/rules (into the space memory seed), and sensors; and
- **modify** existing core stages **additively** via the contribution seam (§5) — enriching what a stage produces, consumes, checks, and instructs, without editing it.

First-party plugins (shipped by the AIDLC team) and third-party plugins (anyone else) are **mechanically identical** — same structure, same seams, same composer, same host-install path. The only difference is provenance: whose repository the plugin lives in and who reviewed it. `plugins/test-pro/` is the reference fixture.

The **design principles** the mechanism holds to:

- **Strict-additive, never override.** Contributions only *add*. Set-union over structural surfaces is commutative, which is what makes independent authors safe; a genuine conflict is a compose error with plugin attribution, never a silent last-writer-wins.
- **Core immutability.** No plugin edits a `core/` file; everything a plugin ships lives in the plugin's own tree.
- **Reversible & inert when off.** Disabling a plugin recomposes to exactly the install without it.
- **Slug is identity.** Stages are identified by slug everywhere that matters (edges, jumps, resolution). `number` is display/ordering only, so an inserted plugin stage never renumbers or destabilizes core.

## 2. Why install-time, delivered as a host plugin

A recurring design question was whether a plugin is a *build-time* artifact (pre-composed centrally, copied in) or an *install-time* one (composed on the consumer's machine over their chosen set). The mechanism is **install-time**, for two structural reasons the wider ecosystem (npm, Cargo, Helm, VS Code, Nix) has already converged on:

- **Combinatorial explosion.** N plugins yield up to 2ⁿ enabled subsets; a central build cannot pre-compose every combination. The only artifact worth pre-building is **bare core** (the empty set), identical for everyone.
- **Late resolution.** The correct plugin set — and how two plugins' contributions to the same stage merge — is only knowable on the install that chose them.

The delivery vehicle is the **host's own plugin system**, not a bespoke AIDLC installer. Every harness the framework targets already ships a manifest-first, git-distributed plugin model (Claude Code `.claude-plugin/`, Codex `.codex-plugin/`); an AIDLC plugin *is* one of those. This is the **hybrid**: real host plugins where a store exists (Claude, Codex), a folder-drop for the one that has none (Kiro). The consequences:

- **We run no distribution infrastructure.** Customers host their own plugin repos (git + semver tags + a `marketplace.json`). One marketplace entry lists a plugin for a mixed fleet.
- **Trust is host-native.** Org restrictions use the host's managed allowlist (Claude `strictKnownMarketplaces`, unoverridable by users; Codex hash-pinned trust). AIDLC builds no trust layer.
- **The composer runs on install, triggered by a host hook.** No pre-built per-combination tree; the SessionStart hook composes the chosen set locally.

> **Security note — Kiro's folder-drop has no install-time trust gate.** Claude and Codex mediate a plugin through their own trust prompts (managed marketplace / hash-pinned approval) *before* its hooks can run. Kiro has no plugin store, so the folder-drop path copies the plugin's files — including the `.kiro.hook` that runs `compose.ts` on the next prompt — with **no equivalent gate**: dropping the tree *is* the trust decision. Treat a Kiro plugin drop like `git clone && run`: only install plugins from a source you would run code from, review the diff the drop introduces, and pin the plugin repo to a reviewed tag rather than tracking a moving branch. The composer itself is additive and never edits `core/`, but the hook it installs executes with your shell's privileges.

The contribution seam (§5) is why this matters: it is structurally VS Code's `contributes` + Cargo's additive feature-union — the best-composing model in the field — and it is available to *every* plugin, first- and third-party alike, with no gatekeeping.

## 3. Plugin structure and manifest

A plugin's tree mirrors `core/`'s shape, so the packager can project it into every harness — authored once, harness-neutral:

The tree mirrors `core/`'s full shape as the *designed* surface; ✅ marks the subtrees the packager projects today, ⏳ marks designed-but-not-yet-projected ones (§6):

```text
plugins/<name>/
  .aidlc-plugin/plugin.json              # the manifest
  stages/<phase>/<slug>.md               # ✅ NEW stages (slug identity; number is display-only)
  sensors/aidlc-<id>.md                  # ✅ NEW sensor manifests
  tools/<id>.ts                          # ✅ sensor scripts (so a sensor can run)
  contributions/<phase>/<slug>.md        # ✅ ADDITIVE modifications to core stages (§5)
  tests/                                 # the plugin's own content validation (integration tier)
  agents/<slug>-agent.md                 # ⏳ NEW agents (not yet projected)
  scopes/aidlc-<name>.md                 # ⏳ NEW scopes (not yet projected)
  memory/{org,team,project}.md           # ⏳ method/rule additions → default-space seed (§6)
  memory/phases/<phase>.md               # ⏳
  knowledge/<agent-slug>/…               # ⏳ per-agent METHODOLOGY knowledge (not yet projected)
```

`.aidlc-plugin/plugin.json` is a **declarative** manifest. Its top level mirrors the common host plugin-manifest shape (so a marketplace or host tooling can list/version/trust it); AIDLC-specific config is isolated in a nested `aidlc` block:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "test-pro",                 // == dir name; "core" is reserved; kebab-case
  "version": "0.1.0",                 // semver; checked against dependents' constraints
  "description": "…",
  "author": { "name": "AWS AIDLC" },
  "dependencies": ["core", "compliance@^1.2.0"],  // resolved vs git tags (<plugin>--v<version>)
  "aidlc": {
    "contributes": {                  // which subtrees this plugin ships
      "stages": "stages/", "agents": "agents/", "scopes": "scopes/",
      "memory": "memory/", "sensors": "sensors/", "knowledge": "knowledge/",
      "tools": "tools/", "overlays": "contributions/"
    }
  }
}
```

Contribution paths are plugin-relative and may not escape the plugin root. The top level is **lenient** (unknown keys preserved, for forward-compat and cross-tool tolerance); the `aidlc` block is *designed* to be **strict** (unknown keys rejected, to catch authoring typos) — but note that today the packager discovers content by directory convention (`stages/`, `sensors/`, `tools/`, `contributions/`), and does **not** yet read the `aidlc.contributes` block or enforce its strictness. Stage numbers are display-only, so a plugin claims no number range in the manifest. `overlays` is the intended name for the contribution directory (§5), consumed by the merge rather than copied.

## 4. Composition model

The composer runs once over `bare core + {chosen plugins}` and writes the effective install. The **same composer** runs regardless of how it is triggered:

| Host | Trigger | Trust |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Claude** | SessionStart hook (fires eagerly on session spawn) | managed allowlist (`strictKnownMarketplaces`) |
| **Codex** | SessionStart hook (fires lazily on first interaction) | one-time trust prompt, content-hash-pinned |
| **Kiro** (CLI/IDE) | manual `bun <plugin>/hooks/compose.ts` after the folder-drop (see §8 — the `.kiro.hook` auto-fire and an `aidlc plugin compose` CLI are not yet wired) | n/a — folder-drop distribution |

The steps (identical regardless of trigger):

1. **Resolve** the chosen plugins plus their transitive `dependencies` closure against published versions.
2. **Copy new primitives** — each plugin's `stages`/`agents`/`scopes`/`sensors`/`tools` subtrees into the corresponding harness roots, substituting the `{{HARNESS_DIR}}` token to the harness's actual dir; `memory` merges into the default-space seed (§6).
3. **Merge contributions** — every active contribution to a stage is folded into the target stage's source (§5): structural surfaces set-unioned, prose fragments spliced at their anchors.
4. **Compile** — `aidlc-graph compile` regenerates `stage-graph.json` + `scope-grid.json`; the orchestrator routes entirely off those, so a plugin stage runs the moment it is composed — no prose or skill edit needed.

Because composition is one N-way merge (not a sequence of independent overlays), **two plugins that both contribute to the same stage are genuinely merged** — structural additions set-union, prose fragments order deterministically — rather than one silently overwriting the other. The runtime stays **read-only** with respect to composition: all merging happens at compose time, never per session. The merge edits **stage source** (not the compiled JSON), so it is **durable** across any later `aidlc-graph compile` (e.g. the runtime-compile hook) and **idempotent** — re-running on every SessionStart composes nothing new.

## 5. The contribution seam

A **contribution** is a file a plugin ships to additively modify a named existing stage, at `contributions/<phase>/<slug>.md`. It never edits the target:

```yaml
---
target: build-and-test        # the existing core stage being enriched
plugin: test-pro
adds:                         # STRUCTURAL — set-unioned into the stage node
  produces:
    - test-pro-regression-suite            # plugin-namespaced (§7)
  consumes:
    - artifact: test-pro-testability-requirements
      required: false
  sensors:
    - coverage-threshold
  required_sections:
    - "Branch Coverage"        # declared H2 (merged into the stage; not machine-enforced yet — see §8)
fragments:                    # PROSE — spliced into the stage body
  - anchor: after-step:9
    order: 100
---

## fragment: after-step:9

### Step 9a (test-pro): Branch + coverage enrichment
…prose the agent reads, inserted after the target stage's Step 9…
```

`bundle:` is still accepted as a deprecated read-side alias for `plugin:`, but new plugin trees should write `plugin:`.

**Merge semantics:**

- **Structural surfaces** — **set union** into the target stage's source frontmatter. Commutative, order-independent, safe across uncoordinated authors. *Implemented today:* `produces`, `consumes` (artifact + `required` + `conditional_on`, each preserved), `sensors`, `required_sections`. *Not yet merged (deferred):* `adds.scopes` and `adds.requires_stage` — a contribution may declare them, but the compose hook records them to the drops log (`--doctor` surfaces it) rather than merging, so their absence is visible, never silent. When these graduate they set-union like the others.
- **Prose fragments** (`fragments` of step/question prose) — spliced into the stage body at the declared anchor, ordered deterministically by `(order, plugin)`. Each spliced block is wrapped in a content-hashed sentinel, so re-composing is idempotent, an upgraded fragment replaces its prior block, and blocks from separate plugins interleave by `(order, plugin)` regardless of hook-firing order. The agent reads base body + ordered fragments at runtime.
- **No override, ever.** A contribution can only add. It cannot change a stage's `lead_agent`, relax a `consumes[].required`, remove a field, or replace existing step prose. A genuine need to *change* upstream behavior is a framework-level decision, never a quiet patch inside a plugin.

**Fragment anchors:**

| Anchor | Inserts the fragment… |
|--------|------------------------|
| `after-step:<n>` | right after `### Step <n>`'s content (before the next heading) |
| `before-step:<n>` | immediately before `### Step <n>` |
| `after-questions` | after the questions-generating step |
| `end-of-steps` | at the end of the `## Steps` block |
| `in:<Compartment>` | at the end of the named `## <Compartment>` block |

**Surface-by-surface** — what a plugin uses for each kind of upstream change. "Status" marks what the compose hook merges today vs. what is designed-but-deferred:

| Change | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Stage asks new questions | `fragments` of question prose | ✅ implemented |
| Stage produces an extra artifact | `adds.produces` + a `fragments` step that emits it | ✅ implemented |
| Stage requires new sections | `adds.required_sections` | ✅ merged (⚠️ declarative — not machine-enforced yet, §8) |
| Add a verification to a stage | `adds.sensors` (+ ship the manifest and `tools/` script) | ✅ implemented |
| Add a consume edge | `adds.consumes` | ✅ implemented |
| Add a `requires_stage` edge | `adds.requires_stage` | ⏳ deferred (declared → logged, not merged) |
| Put an existing stage under a plugin scope | `adds.scopes` (or the scope's own `includes_*` — §7) | ⏳ deferred (declared → logged, not merged) |
| Inject phase policy / guardrails | ship `memory/phases/<p>.md` into the default-space seed (§6) | ⏳ deferred (not yet projected) |

## 6. Method/rules, knowledge, scopes, and activation (design — largely deferred)

This section describes the *designed* surfaces beyond new stages + the contribution seam. **Most are not yet wired into the emitter/compose hook** — the packager projects only a plugin's `stages/`, `sensors/`, `tools/`, and `contributions/` today. The rest below is the intended shape, marked with its status so an author is not misled:

**Method/rules → the memory seed** *(⏳ deferred).* The framework's rule layer is the per-space **memory** tree (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/memory/{org,team,project}.md`, `phases/<phase>.md`), seeded from `core/memory/`. The design is that a plugin contributes a `memory/phases/<p>.md` that set-unions into that seed. The packager does not yet project a plugin's `memory/` tree, so this has no effect today.

**Knowledge = methodology only** *(⏳ deferred).* The design ships per-agent methodology knowledge into `<harness>/knowledge/<agent-slug>/`. Not yet projected. Domain/space knowledge (`aidlc/spaces/<space>/knowledge/`) is empty-at-bootstrap user runtime state a plugin neither ships nor seeds.

**Scopes** *(⏳ deferred).* The design is that a scope's *identity* is one file a plugin ships under `scopes/`, and its *membership* is additive (scope-side `includes_*` or a contribution's `adds.scopes`). The packager does not yet project `scopes/`, and `adds.scopes` is logged-not-merged (§5), so a plugin cannot yet define or join a scope.

**Activation (`when:`)** *(⚠️ parsed, not evaluated).* A stage may carry a structured `when:` predicate; `{producer-in-plan: X}` is schema-validated and parsed, but **no engine consumer evaluates it yet** — `aidlc-graph` names itself the future home. So a stage carrying `when:` is today EXECUTE under its declared scopes unconditionally. A plugin's own stages exist only when the plugin is in the chosen set, so "is this plugin active" is already a compose-time fact.

**`plugin.json` `aidlc.contributes`** *(⏳ deferred).* The manifest may carry an `aidlc.contributes` block, but the packager currently discovers content by directory convention (`stages/`, `sensors/`, `tools/`, `contributions/`), not from that block — it is not yet read. There is no `aidlc.lock.json` read either; the composer resolves nothing from a lockfile today.

## 7. Multi-tenant guards

Independent authors who never coordinate are kept safe by:

- **Namespacing.** Contributed artifact logical names are `<plugin>-`prefixed; `core-*` is reserved. A plugin's stages, agents, scopes, and sensors are validated for slug-uniqueness across the chosen set and against core — a collision is a hard compose error with attribution (no silent shadowing).
- **Dependency resolution.** `dependencies` resolve by semver against git tags; cycles are rejected; an unsatisfiable dependency is a compose error naming the requiring plugin.
- **Deterministic ordering.** The one non-commutative surface (prose fragments) is ordered by explicit `(order, plugin)`, never by load order.
- **Conflicts fail loud.** A genuinely non-commutative collision — the same stage's same fragment anchor at the same order, an unsatisfiable cross-plugin edge, a duplicate primitive slug — errors at compose with attribution, rather than resolving by overlay order.

## 8. As-built: emission, install, and the worked example

`bun scripts/package.ts` discovers `plugins/<name>/` (any dir with `.aidlc-plugin/plugin.json`) and emits a per-harness host plugin at `dist/plugins/<name>/<harness>/` — one more projection target alongside the four harness trees. Each projection carries the host-native manifest (`.claude-plugin/` / `.codex-plugin/` / `.kiro-plugin/`), a `marketplace.json`, the compose hook, and the plugin's content (stages with full `number`/`plugin`/`when` frontmatter — the schema accepts them natively). The compose hook is a single portable `compose.ts` (bun — no GNU-specific shell) that is **harness-agnostic**: plugin root resolves from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT | PLUGIN_ROOT | AIDLC_PLUGIN_ROOT`, project dir from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR | AIDLC_PROJECT_DIR | PWD` (Codex leaves the project-dir var unset — PWD is the fallback), and the harness leaf from `AIDLC_HARNESS_DIR`, which each host's hook command exports. It copies new stages without clobbering, merges the seam idempotently (content-hashed sentinel splices, compare-before-write), and records any contribution it has to drop (missing target, malformed anchor, a key the installed engine won't accept) to `<hooksHealthDir>/plugin-compose.drops` — the same per-space health dir core hooks write to and `/aidlc --doctor` scans — rather than failing the session.

**Install, per host:**

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add <repo-or-path>/dist/plugins/<name>/claude
/plugin install aidlc-<name>@aidlc-plugins        # SessionStart hook composes on next session

# Codex CLI (in a git repo)
codex plugin marketplace add <…>/dist/plugins/<name>/codex
codex plugin add aidlc-<name>@aidlc-plugins       # approve the one-time hook trust

# Kiro (no store — folder-drop, then run the composer explicitly).
# PLUGIN_ROOT is the emitted projection dir (it carries hooks/compose.ts + the
# plugin content); PROJECT_DIR is the install you dropped .kiro into.
PLUGIN_ROOT="$(pwd)/dist/plugins/<name>/kiro"
cp -r "$PLUGIN_ROOT"/. <project>/
AIDLC_PLUGIN_ROOT="$PLUGIN_ROOT" AIDLC_PROJECT_DIR="<project>" \
  AIDLC_HARNESS_DIR=.kiro bun "$PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/compose.ts"
# ^ the one working invocation today. A `.kiro.hook` auto-fire and an
#   `aidlc plugin compose` wrapper CLI are designed but NOT yet wired (see Status).
```

Then `/aidlc --doctor` reflects the chosen set (e.g. a 34-stage graph for `core + test-pro`), and a scoped run (`/aidlc --scope enterprise`) routes the plugin's stages wherever their scopes put them on-path.

**Worked example — test-pro across a mixed fleet.** A platform team publishes `test-pro` once (author against `core/`, `bun scripts/package.ts`, push a `<plugin>--v<version>` tag, drop a `marketplace.json`). Claude teams `/plugin install`; Codex teams `codex plugin add` (approve trust once); Kiro teams `git pull` + run the composer explicitly (above). In every case the composer merges test-pro's two new stages **and** its contributions to `build-and-test`/`nfr-requirements`/`nfr-design`/`performance-validation` — the same enriched, 34-stage, doctor-clean install. Validated across all four harness projections (Claude, Codex, Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE).

**Status.** Implemented and validated: schema support for `number`/`name`/`plugin`/`when` (`aidlc-stage-schema.ts`); the packager emitter (all four harness projections); the harness-agnostic compose hook (`scripts/plugin-hooks-template/compose.ts`); the contribution seam for `produces` / `consumes` / `sensors` / `required_sections` + prose fragments (content-hashed, idempotent, order-deterministic). Guarded by `tests/integration/t188-plugin-compose.test.ts` (the compose mechanism) + each plugin's own `tests/` (content; wired into the integration tier). **Deferred / not yet wired:** the `.kiro.hook` auto-fire and an `aidlc plugin compose` wrapper CLI (Kiro composes via the explicit `bun compose.ts` invocation today); projection of a plugin's `agents/` / `scopes/` / `memory/` / `knowledge/` subtrees; `adds.scopes` / `adds.requires_stage` merge (declared → logged); `when:` predicate evaluation (parsed, no engine consumer); machine-enforcement of merged `required_sections` (the field merges + validates but does not reach the compiled node, and the shipped required-sections sensor derives its expectations from templates — nothing fails a stage for a missing declared section yet); the `after-questions` fragment anchor (`locateAnchor` has no case — it drop-logs "unknown anchor"; use `after-step:<n>`); reading `aidlc.contributes` / any lockfile / `dependencies`; and compile-side carry-through of authored `number`/`plugin` into the compiled node (stages route on re-seeded numbers today).

## 9. Invariants

- **Core is immutable.** No plugin ever edits `core/`.
- **Additive-only.** Contributions add; they never override or remove.
- **Inert when off.** Disabling every plugin yields bare core, byte-identical.
- **One composer, host-triggered.** The same code composes wherever it runs; the only centrally pre-built artifact is bare core.
- **A plugin IS a host plugin.** The packager emits real `.claude-plugin/` / `.codex-plugin/` / `.kiro-plugin/` manifests, installed through the host's native commands. AIDLC runs no distribution infrastructure.
- **Slug identity, display-only numbers.** Inserting a plugin stage never renumbers core.
- **Trust is host-native.** Org restrictions use the host's managed allowlist; AIDLC builds no trust layer.
- **No gatekeeping.** First- and third-party plugins are mechanically equal; provenance is the only difference.
