//
// t123 (smoke) — Agent-Skills-spec structural conformance over EVERY shipped
// skill dir under dist/claude/.claude/skills/. Migrated from
// tests/smoke/t123-skills-spec-conformance.sh (TAP plan: 1 dir-count guard +
// 5 structural assertions per skill = 1 + 5×38 = 191 assertions).
//
// Mechanism: none. There is no tool / process / argv seam under test — the
// subject IS the on-disk shape of the shipped skill set and the bytes of each
// SKILL.md. The .sh sourced lib/tap.sh and shelled to `bun -e` only to PARSE
// (read the graph, extract the frontmatter `name`); it never invoked an aidlc
// tool as a process-boundary contract. So the twin reads the same static files
// in-process (resolved from the harness's AIDLC_SRC, the same
// dist/claude/.claude root the .sh reached via $CLAUDE_DIR) and asserts. Zero
// LLM, zero tokens, zero subprocess. The ONE in-repo import - defaultScopeBatch
// from aidlc-runner-gen.ts - is a pure function import, not a spawn (the .sh
// hardcoded the same four scope-runner names in SCOPE_RUNNER_SKILLS; calling
// the function is STRONGER: it tracks the generator's source of truth so a
// default-batch edit flows into this guard automatically).
//
// Subject under test (the shipped skill set + each SKILL.md):
//   dist/claude/.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md — for the DERIVED expected set:
//     - 4 base skills (orchestrator + 3 read-only session skills)
//     - the generator's default-batch scope-runners (imported here, not
//       hardcoded)
//     - one aidlc-<slug> per RUNNABLE compiled stage (every stage whose
//       phase !== "initialization", read from tools/data/stage-graph.json
//       exactly as the .sh's `bun -e` did — the array of stage records)
//     - the single /aidlc-init phase wrapper
//   Each conformant SKILL.md must: exist; carry frontmatter `name:` equal to
//   the dir name; carry a `description:` line; carry NO `hooks:` block (Fork
//   2→B moved the deterministic spine project-wide into settings.json); and
//   keep its body within the Agent-Skills 500-line ceiling.
//
// DERIVED, never hardcoded (the .sh's central design promise): the expected
// set is computed from the same two sources the .sh used — stage-graph.json
// (filtered to non-initialization phases) + defaultScopeBatch() - so a stage
// added to the graph flows into this guard automatically and cannot silently
// ship a non-conformant runner. The dir-count guard (test 1) then proves the on-disk
// shipped set EQUALS that derived set.
//
// Old TAP -> new test parity (1:1, no guarantee dropped; several STRONGER):
//   .sh test 1 (dir-count: shipped set == base 4 + 4 scope-runners +
//       29 stage-runners + aidlc-init, sorted assert_eq)
//         -> "shipped skill set == derived expected set (sorted, exact)"
//            STRONGER: asserts the two sorted arrays equal element-by-element
//            (toEqual), not just the joined string the .sh compared.
//   .sh per-skill test A (assert_file_exists SKILL.md)
//         -> per-skill "SKILL.md exists"
//   .sh per-skill test B (frontmatter name == dir, via bun -e parse)
//         -> per-skill "frontmatter name == dir" (same `^name:` extraction,
//            quote-stripped, block-scoped to the --- front-matter)
//   .sh per-skill test C (assert_grep "^description:")
//         -> per-skill "has a description: line" (same `^description:` anchor)
//   .sh per-skill test D (assert_not_grep "^hooks:")
//         -> per-skill "carries no hooks: block" (same `^hooks:` anchor — the
//            failure event MUST be reachable: a SKILL.md that grows a hooks:
//            block fails this row, mirroring assert_not_grep)
//   .sh per-skill test E (wc -l <= 500, ok/not_ok)
//         -> per-skill "SKILL.md body <= 500 lines"
//
// 1 + 5×38 = 191 .sh assertions -> 1 set-equality test() + 5 expect()s ×
// 38 skills (190) = 191 expect()-bearing assertions, same observables, the
// dir-count + name-derivation STRONGER.
